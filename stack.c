 * * f_stack - Sets the behavior of the stack mode.
 *
 * This function sets the behavior of the stack mode in the Monty interpreter.
 * It is designed to be used with the Monty language opcode "stack". The function
 * doesn't perform any operation other than indicating that the interpreter
 * should operate in stack mode. The `counter` parameter represents the line
 * number in the Monty script, and it is included for consistency with other
 * opcode functions.
 *
 * @head: Pointer to the head of the stack (unused).
 * @counter: Line number for consistency with other opcode functions.
 *
 * Authors: Originally implemented by 2012Inga.
 * Return: No return value.
